# Taskinator

## Purpose

Web APIs and DOM Elements

## About Project

In this project, I build a tasks to do list and added an "Add Task button which allows users to create a task and add it to that list. I built this project using HTML and CSS for the basic structure and design of the project. I created a DOM element for the "Add Task" button. In addition to, I created a function to observe the user's click of the button element which created a response from that click. Please see the screenshot animation below.
